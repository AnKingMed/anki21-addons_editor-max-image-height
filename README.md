Editor max image height
=======================

This add on allows to limit the height of the images displayed in the Anki card editor so that all the fields are (possibly) visible together.

To change the maximum image height, go to

    Tools > Add-ons > Editor max image height > Config

and set the variable _max-height_ equal to the pixels you want.
